<p>&ldquo;When asked to pick three attributes about John Fornof, I clicked all seven listed (great results, personable, expert, good value, on time, high integrity, and creative). John is not only technically outstanding as a film produce or screen writer, he's creative, flexible in dealing with &quot;talent,&quot; has an incredible production team he's gathered, and did an absolutely outstanding job on several projects we've given him. On time, on budget, exceeded expectations. If you're looking for a person to do a DVD series, promotional film, or longer treatment, John is the best we've ever seen or used.&rdquo;  John Trent, The Center for StrongFamilies and StrongFamilies.com &ldquo;John is a very gracious collaborator. He makes a great pitch when introducing a new idea, and can also roll with changes when the situation calls for it. He works well both independently and as a team member.&rdquo; Steve O'Dell, Creative Director, CBH Ministries</p>
